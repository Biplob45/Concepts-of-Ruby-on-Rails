# Concepts-of-Ruby-on-Rails

Ruby on Rails follows several principles to help keep it's code sleek
and clean. You should try to live by these principles while you're
working with RoR to get the most of it. For one, it follows the Agile
programming term of DRY (Don't repeat yourself). Obviously, this means
that you only write your code once in a certain consistent place. For
example, if you need the code to do a certain thing, then you'll put it
in a certain place every time.

The second concept that RoR follows is CoC (Conventions over
Configuration).This pretty much means that ruby assumes a lot, and
explains most of the automatic defaults you'll see ruby generate for us.
Instead of you always having to configure everything, in every single
project, ruby does it for you automatically.Then, if you want to do
something that's unconventional, you simply override the sensible
defaults that RoR already has in place.This generally leads to less code
having to be written.

Advantages of Learning Ruby on Rails:

It is pretty easy to learn compared to other languages
Completely Object Orientated
MVC Architecture
You don't have to write as much code
Very extendible
Open Source
The community is extremely helpful in answering questions
Despite being a relatively new framework, it is pretty fully featured,
and has very few bugs.
Disadvantages of Ruby:

Processed different, so the code can be a little bit slower on servers
that aren't really built to handle ruby code
I've only heard this claim, but more and more servers are becoming
better equipped for Rails as it continues to grow anyway so it's
becoming less and less of a problem.
